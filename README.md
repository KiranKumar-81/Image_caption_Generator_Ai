# Image Caption Generator AI

## Overview

This project implements an Image Caption Generator using deep learning techniques. The model is designed to automatically generate descriptive captions for images, combining computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). The primary objective of this AI system is to provide accurate, context-aware captions for a wide range of images.

## Features

* **Image Captioning**: Generate descriptive and contextually relevant captions for any given image.
* **Deep Learning Model**: Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory), for generating captions.
* **Pretrained Models**: Leverages pretrained models for both image feature extraction and language modeling.
* **Interactive Demo**: Upload an image and get captions in real time.
* **Multi-Language Support**: Caption generation is available in multiple languages (optional depending on model configuration).

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-caption-generator.git
   cd image-caption-generator
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install required packages.

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download Pretrained Models**:
   You can either download the pretrained models from the provided link or train your own using the dataset.

## Usage

### 1. **Live Demo**

You can try the image captioning model directly through our [interactive demo hosted on Netlify](https://astonishing-pasca-fb4425.netlify.app). Upload an image, and the model will generate captions in real time!

### 2. **Local Usage**

If you'd like to run the model locally, follow the steps below.

1. **Load the model**:

   ```python
   from caption_generator import CaptionGenerator
   caption_generator = CaptionGenerator()
   caption_generator.load_model('path_to_model')
   ```

2. **Generate Caption for an Image**:

   ```python
   image_path = 'path_to_image.jpg'
   caption = caption_generator.generate_caption(image_path)
   print("Generated Caption:", caption)
   ```

3. **Run the demo** (if included in the repo):
   If you have a web interface or demo script:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   Then open `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser to interact with the image caption generator.

## Model Architecture

This project uses a combination of CNNs and LSTMs:

* **CNN** (e.g., InceptionV3 or ResNet) is used to extract features from the image.
* **LSTM** is used for generating captions based on the extracted image features.
* **Attention Mechanism** (if included) helps the model focus on different parts of the image while generating the caption.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the **MS COCO** (Common Objects in Context) dataset, which contains over 330,000 images with captions. You can download the dataset from [here](http://cocodataset.org/).

If you want to train the model from scratch, make sure to preprocess the dataset and adjust hyperparameters accordingly.

## Model Training

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:

   * Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels).
   * Tokenize captions and create a vocabulary.

2. **Training**:

   * Use `train.py` to train the model from scratch or fine-tune an existing model.
   * Example:

     ```bash
     python train.py --epochs 20 --batch_size 64
     ```

3. **Evaluate**:
   After training, you can evaluate the model's performance using metrics like BLEU score, METEOR, or ROUGE.

## Example Outputs

* **Input Image**:
  ![Example Image](example_image.jpg)

* **Generated Caption**:
  "A group of people riding horses on a beach during sunset."
